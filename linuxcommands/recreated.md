#Linux commands recreated

Also from when I was learning Node.js.
This idea came to mind when I first subscribed to the NodeOS project.
I thought the idea of building a Node.js-based OS (not the intire OS, but you get the idea) was pretty damn cool, so I got inspired.
It was some good training, becaus I was able to get a grip of the callback concept using the 'fs' module.
But due to working at a Lab and my final tests on their way, the inspiration ran off hehe.
