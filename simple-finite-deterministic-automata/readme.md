<h1>Simple Finite Deterministic Automata</h1>

It was requested in our 'Automata and Formal Languages' class that we built a simple finite determinist automata.

I used node.js to develop the automata.

The graphic representation of the automata can be viewed in the .png file in this repository

The language accepted by the automata is:</br>
 L = { any binary number with an even number of 0's and 1's , Îµ }
  
How to use it:</br>
 node finite_deterministic_automata.js <tape to be verified. e.g. 10101010>
  
<h2>Note</h2>
  <h3>This script uses ECMAScript 6, so you need node v5.5.0 or above</h3>
