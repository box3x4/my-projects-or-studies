#Data Structures

A few data structures implementations of Lists, queue, heaps and trees.
In this folder, there's a implementation for: Double linked list, Linked list, Circular linked list, Binary and AVL Tree(C/C++ and Java), Queue and Min and max Heap.
The source code was written in C/C++ or Java, and the comments are in portuguese, I'm sorry x.x
I couldn't find the source code for the Java ones, only the .JAR files. I'm sorry [2] x.x
