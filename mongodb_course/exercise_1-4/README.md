The problem:

"Write a Node.js web application that presents users with a form containing three fields and a submit button. The fields should be:

title
year
imdb

Set up a route to handle a POST request of this form. This route should use the Node.js MongoDB driver to insert a movie document into MongoDB. The movie document should have the same shape as those we looked at in lesson examples this week.

Check that you are inserting records correctly in the Mongo shell with some find() commands."

to run, enter the directory and run
```c
npm install
node app.js
```
